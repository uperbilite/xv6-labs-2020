It will be important to understand a bit of RISC-V assembly, which you were exposed to in 6.004. There is a file user/call.c in your xv6 repo. make fs.img compiles it and also produces a readable assembly version of the program in user/call.asm.

Read the code in call.asm for the functions g, f, and main. The instruction manual for RISC-V is on the reference page. Here are some questions that you should answer (store the answers in a file answers-traps.txt):

Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
At what address is the function printf located?
What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

Here's a description of little- and big-endian and a more whimsical description.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
